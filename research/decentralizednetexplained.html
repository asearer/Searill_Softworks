    <h1>Decentralized Networks Explained</h1>
    <div class="int">
        <p>
            Imagine a decentralized network as a large, global system that doesn't rely on a single central authority or control point, like a traditional organization or a government. Instead, it operates through a vast number of individual participants, kind of like a massive group of people working together.

        </p>

    <div class="simp"> 
        <p>Here's a simple way to think about it:</p>
    </div> 
     <div class="para">   
    <div class="p1">
            <p>
                <b><u>No Central Boss:</u></b> <br><br>In a decentralized network, there's no single "boss" or central authority making all the decisions. Instead, decisions are made collectively by the participants.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p2">   
            <p>
                <b><u>Shared Responsibility:</u></b> <br><br>Think of it as a community effort. Everyone in the network has a role, and they work together to keep things running smoothly.
            </p>
    </div>  
    <div class="p3">  
            <p>
                <b><u>Distributed Power:</u></b> <br><br>Power and control are spread out among many different people or computers. It's not controlled by just one person or organization.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p4">    
            <p>
                <b><u>Trust Through Consensus:</u></b> <br><br>Instead of trusting a central authority, everyone in the network trusts the system itself because they all agree on how it works. This agreement is called consensus.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p5">   
            <p>
                <b><u>Resilience:</u> </b><br><br>If one part of the network fails or gets attacked, the rest of the network can keep functioning. It's like a web where if one thread breaks, the rest still hold things together.
            </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="conc">     
        <p>In practical terms, this concept is often used in technologies like blockchain, where many computers (nodes) work together to record and verify transactions without needing a central bank or authority. It's a way to create trust, security, and fairness in a digital world without relying on a single, powerful entity.</p>
